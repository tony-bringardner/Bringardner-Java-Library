# Tony Bringardner
With 50 years of experience in the Information Technology field, designing building and maintaining large computer systems, I've successfully executed just about every position available in the field from entry level programmer to CTO (Chief Technology Officer) of a large financial organization, including, but not limited to project / team leader, architect.

My passion and driving force has always be writing code. I've worked with many programming languages including Basic, C, C++, C#, fortran, pascal, perl, bash, tcl/tk, Javascript, Go, Fiddler,... Now that I'm retired, I spend much of my time writing Java code.  

I've always be infatuated with network communications and open Internet protocols.  I don't think you can really understand a protocol until you've written at least one client and server implementing it.
